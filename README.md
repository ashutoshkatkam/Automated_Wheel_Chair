# Automated_Wheel_Chair

Our team main aim is to solve the problem of mobility of paralyzed people by controlling the speed and direction of the wheel chair by head movements.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Our problem statement is to help the paralyzed to move their wheel chair without others assistance. To transform our idea into actions we've started building our prototype.

TEAM'S APPROACH:
Our teamâ€™s main aim to solve the problem of the mobility of the paralyzed people by controlling the speed and direction of the wheelchair by the head movements that help in moving from one place to another place easily with a negligible amount of difficulty.

We could design an electronic wheelchair that would move according to the instructions of the patient by his head movements and that would be completely wireless transmission with good accuracy.

 

This prototype solves the problem of mobility of paralyzed people by controlling speed and direction of wheel chair. The head movements decide the speed and direction of wheel chair with almost negligible amount of difficulty  

Components
STM 32
NRF 24L01
GYRO SENSOR(MPU6050)
MOTOR DRIVER(L298N)
CENTER SHAFT MOTORS

WORKING
The Automatic Wheel Chair it's movement is depends upon the change in degrees of freedom detected by the gyro sensor (X,Y,Z axis) . The information is transferred by the nrf module attached to the gyro sensor and received by the nrf module attached to the wheel chair. This whole information transferring  occurs in SPI communication protocol .

The movements of wheels of the wheel chair is controlled by the motor driver , which can be altered  by the motion of the user's head
